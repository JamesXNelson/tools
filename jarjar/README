This is a compiled version of the newest available jarjar fork online:
https://github.com/Dica-Developer/jarjar

The ancient 1.4 version distributed online can no longer process java 8+ classes,
so updating to libraries like guava that now use modern java, we must also use
a modern version of jarjar.

You may add the bin directory to your path,
or, ideally, leave scripts in directories that need to run jarjar,
so the next developer can update jars with a (simple) one-liner.
